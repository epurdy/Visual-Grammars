abstract - abstraction over grammars and sdfs
annotation - interacts with hand marked green dotted images. Produces .annotation files representing this.
bounds - axis-aligned rectangular regions
con - Various constants
curve - Curves, as described in the paper
curve_network - like a planar graph. Points and curve segments (not curves from curve.ml though)
geometry - 2d points
grammar - probabilistic models of curves based on grammar
examples/ and examples.mlpack - just one hand.ml (hand built grammar)
parsing - does CKY parsing given a grammr and sdf (i think)
parzen - Parezen estimator to a non-parametric distribution
retrain - EM retraining (takes data from a prse and refits midpoint distributions)
sdf - decompositions of curves or the indicies of a curve (sparse decomposition family)
shape - Representing shapes (mid point distribution)
svg - SVG interactions
viz - visualize stuff

config - old probably should die as new experiment stuff is built
datasets - old probably should die as new experiment stuff is built
