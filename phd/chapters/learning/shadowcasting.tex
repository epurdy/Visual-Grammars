Can we modify em to express some constraint on the model? For
instance, if we want to model convex curves, we could generate random
curves, find the non-convex ones, and somehow use those as negative
observations (a la contrastive divergence)

Could weight them negatively according to how much they violate our
constraint

We can think of it like this: if we had lots and lots of data, then we
would hope that our model estimation procedure would work. But, since
we have relatively little data, we want to somehow use our intuition
about the domain to suggest more data.

In general, can have any sort of positive and negative observations...

Need to be able to use negative observations in our estimators. For
us, we have multinomial counts and the procrustes mean, relatively
clear how it should be done. Need to watch out that the procrustes
mean matrix remains psd, or the eigenvalues will behave weirdly.
