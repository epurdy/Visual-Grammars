Motivating example is squares

draw pictures of input and ideal output, outline ideal output squares
in red

Input should be noisy?

S -> XX
X -> YY
Y -> l

Show mincost(S), mincost(X), mincost(Y)

Also show all detections of S,X,Y without any NMS, where detection is
mincost(*) plus some delta.

Demonstrate parsing a scene by erasing evidence. Have some plausible
sub-objects, like squares that go off the side of the image or off two
sides.

Scene parsing like this is an approximation to global minimum of scene
grammar, usually an acceptable approximation.
