This is a serious problem without a good answer. Dynamic programming
is fundamentally unable to deal with this issue.  \marginnote{Pedro
  has a proof somewhere that bag-parsing is NP-complete in some
  setting.}

We are currently coping with this problem by alternating parsing with
a local inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling that tries to
label edge pixels with an orientation, and tries to label non-edge
pixels as interior or exterior to the object. We then reparse, using
only line segments that do not contradict the local interpretation too
much.
