In \cite{hcm}, hierarchical curve models are used to find shapes in
cluttered images. The same thing can be done for our models.

% We can test this out on the ETHZ dataset, which is relatively easy. We
% could also try to find curves in the much harder LabelMe dataset.

\subsection{Parsing in Cluttered Images}
Given a shape model and an image containing a similar shape, we would
like to be able to find the shape in the image. This is done by
searching for a shape that is rated highly by the shape model, and for
which evidence exists in the image.

We will work on solving harder and harder versions of this problem:
  - Take a known curve, and generate evidence that suggests that
    curve, and no other curve. Find the curve.
  - As above, but randomly add evidence to other parts of the image.
  - Extract evidence from an actual image, and use this to find the
    curve.
