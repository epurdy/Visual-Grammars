\subsection{Build an interesting grammar by hand}
\marginnote{Should probably do hand here?}

\marginnote{Move this experiment to the section on building a grammar
  from a single curve.}

Here we are drawing a grammar. We have built this grammar by hand, by
taking the following curve, and specifying a decomposition of it:

\begin{figure}

\caption{The initial curve}
\end{figure}

Here is the decomposition:

\end{figure}

Here is the grammar:
