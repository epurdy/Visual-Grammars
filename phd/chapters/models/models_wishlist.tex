\begin{itemize}

\item Sample and compute cross-entropy for Markov models, Watson,
  indep Gaussians, indep non-parametric. Those last two models are
  only different if we are training on multiple curves, but we can do
  that relatively easily with the hand-annotated Romer curves.

\item Talk about classification experiments.

\item Explain lengthening rules ($X\to XX$) and shortening rules
  ($X\to \ell$).

\end{itemize}
