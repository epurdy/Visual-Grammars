\begin{itemize}
\item Swedish Leaf dataset. Here we are given the silhouettes of
  leaves from fifteen different species of tree. (Species include
  maple, oak, and some sort of willow.) For each class, we are given
  25 example leaves, and then we want to build a classifier that will
  accurately classify another 50 examples from each species.

\item MPEG7.
