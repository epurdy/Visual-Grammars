This is just a convenient reference for me as I try to keep all the
notation consistent and intuitive.

\bitem
\item Nonterminals: $X,Y,Z$ (use superscripts to enumerate)
\item Placed nonterminals: $X_{p,q}$
\item Start nonterminals: $S,T$
\item Terminal: $\ell$
\item Placed terminal: $\ell_{p,q}$
\item Curves: $A,B,C, C_n$
\item Points: $c_i$
\item Curvilinear forms: $\lambda, \mu, \nu$ ($\sigma$ for starting)
\item Grammars: $\GGG, \HHH$
\item Set of nonterminals: $\NNN$
\item Set of starting nonterminals: $\SSS$
\item Set of rules: $\RRR, \RRR(X)$
\item Set of midpoint distributions: $\MMM$
\item Set of rule-choice distributions: $\XXX$.
\item Do we want to differentiate open/closed curves notationally?
$ST$ vs. $\overline{ST}$ is reasonable, if so.
