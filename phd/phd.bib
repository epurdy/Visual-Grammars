    abstract = {We introduce an extension of dynamic programming ({DP}) we call "{Coarse-to-Fine} Dynamic Programming" ({CFDP}), ideally suited to {DP} problems with large state space. {CFDP} uses dynamic programming to solve a sequence of coarse approximations which are lower bounds to the original {DP} problem. These approximations are developed by merging states in the original graph into "superstates" in a coarser graph which uses an optimistic arc cost between superstates. The approximations are designed so that when {CFDP} terminates the optimal path through the original state graph has been found. {CFDP} leads to significant decreases in the amount of computation necessary to solve many {DP} problems and can, in some instances, make otherwise infeasible computations possible. {CFDP} generalizes to {DP} problems with continuous state space and we offer a convergence result for this extension. The computation of the approximations requires that we bound the arc cost over all possible arcs associated with an adjacent pair of superstates; thus the feasibility of our proposed method requires the identification of such a lower bound. We demonstrate applications of this technique to optimization of functions and boundary estimation in mine recognition.},

@techreport{grammar-tr,
    abstract = {We formulate a general grammar model motivated by the problem of object detection in computer vision. We focus on four aspects of modeling objects for the purpose of object detection. First, we are interested in modeling objects as having parts which are themselves (recursively) objects. For example a person can be represented as being composed of a face, a trunk, arms, and legs where a face is composed of eyes, a nose and a mouth. Second, we are interested modeling object (and part) categories as being composed of subcategories or subtypes. For example we might distinguish sitting people from standing people and smiling faces from frowning faces. Third, we are interested in modeling the relative positions of the parts that make up an object. For example, in a person, the position of the hand is related to the position of the lower arm which is related to the position of the upper arm which is related to the position of the torso. Fourth, we are interested in modeling the appearance of objects so that we can find them in images. For example, a pattern of edges in a particular location of an image might give evidence for, or against, the presence of a part at that location. These four aspects of models --- parts, subtypes, positions, and appearance --- can be represented in a single grammar formalism that we call an object detection grammar.},

The features capture natural local structures in the data and yield very high classification rates when used with a variety of classifiers trained on small training sets, exhibiting robustness to degradation with clutter. Of particular interest is the use of the features as variables in simple statistical models for the objects thus enabling likelihood based classification. Pre-training decision boundaries between classes, a necessary component of non-parametric techniques, are thus avoided. Class models are trained separately with no need to access data of other classes. Experimental results are presented for handwritten character recognition, classification of deformed BTEX symbols involving hundreds of classes, and side view car detection.},

@article{canny,
    abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

The book commences with a short overview of pattern theory and the basics of statistics and estimation theory. Chapters 3-6 discuss the role of representation of patterns via condition structure. Chapters 7 and 8 examine the second central component of pattern theory: groups of geometric transformation applied to the representation of geometric objects. Chapter 9 moves into probabilistic structures in the continuum, studying random processes and random fields indexed over subsets of Rn. Chapters 10 and 11 continue with transformations and patterns indexed over the continuum. Chapters 12-14 extend from the pure representations of shapes to the Bayes estimation of shapes and their parametric representation. Chapters 15 and 16 study the estimation of infinite dimensional shape in the newly emergent field of Computational Anatomy. Finally, Chapters 17 and 18 look at inference, exploring random sampling approaches for estimation of model order and parametric representing of shapes.},

The exact properties of human shape similarity judgements are not well understood yet, and this task is particularly difficult in domains where the shapes are not related by rigid transformations. In this paper we identify a number of possibly desirable properties of a shape similarity method, and determine the extent to which these properties can be captured by approaches that compare local properties of the contours of the shapes, through elastic matching. Special attention is devoted to objects that possess articulations, i.e. articulated parts. Elastic matching evaluates the similarity of two shapes as the sum of local deformations needed to change one shape into another. We show that similarities of part structure can be captured by such an approach, without the explicit computation of part structure. This may be of importance, since although parts appear to play a significant role in visual recognition, it is difficult to stably determine part structure. We also show novel results about how one can evaluate smooth and polyhedral shapes with the same method. Finally, we describe shape similarity effects that cannot be handled by current approaches.},

Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets. <P>The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it.

In its quest for a stochastic and context sensitive grammar of images, it is intended to serve as a unified frame-work of representation, learning, and recognition for a large number of object categories. It starts out by addressing the historic trends in the area and overviewing the main concepts: such as the and-or graph, the parse graph, the dictionary and goes on to learning issues, semantic gaps between symbols and pixels, dataset for learning and algorithms. The proposal grammar presented integrates three prominent representations in the literature: stochastic grammars for composition, Markov (or graphical) models for contexts, and sparse coding with primitives (wavelets). It also combines the structure-based and appearance based methods in the vision literature. At the end of the review, three case studies are presented to illustrate the proposed grammar. A Stochastic Grammar of Images is an important contribution to the literature on structured statistical models in computer vision.},

@techreport{Aycinena2008Learning,
    abstract = {Many object recognition systems are limited by their inability to share common parts or structure among related object classes. This capability is desirable because it allows information about parts and relationships in one object class to be generalized to other classes for which it is relevant. With this goal in mind, we have designed a representation and recognition framework that captures structural variability and shared part structure within and among object classes. The framework uses probabilistic geometric grammars (PGGs) to represent object classes recursively in terms of their parts, thereby exploiting the hierarchical and substitutive structure inherent to many types of objects. To incorporate geometric and appearance information, we extend traditional probabilistic context-free grammars to represent distributions over the relative geometric characteristics of object parts as well as the appearance of primitive parts. We describe an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for object categorization and localization in images given a PGG model. We also develop an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of a grammar structure from training data, and a search-based structure learning approach that finds a compact grammar to explain the image data while sharing substructure among classes. Finally, we describe a set of experiments that demonstrate empirically that the system provides a performance benefit.},

@inproceedings{Zhang2006SVMKNN,
    abstract = {We consider visual category recognition in the framework of measuring similarities, or equivalently perceptual distances, to prototype examples of categories. This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05\%(±0.56\%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23\%(±0.48\%) at 30 training images.},

The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. Shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Moreover, the shape context leads to a robust score for measuring shape similarity, once shapes are aligned. The shape context descriptor is tolerant to all common shape deformations. As a key advantage no special landmarks or key-points are necessary. It is thus a generic method with applications in object recognition, image registration and point set matching.

Storing too many exemplars can result in large memory requirements and slow execution speed, and can cause an oversensitivity to noise. This paper has two main purposes. First, it provides a survey of existing algorithms used to reduce the number of exemplars retained in exemplar-based learning models.

These algorithms and 10 algorithms from the survey are compared on 31 datasets. Of those algorithms that provide substantial storage reduction, the DROP algorithms have the highest generalization accuracy in these experiments, especially in the presence of noise.},

    abstract = {SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence of discrete symbols by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase, and continuing this process recursively. The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000 symbols per second and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences. 1.

@electronic{KomodakisImage,
    abstract = {In this paper, a new exemplar-based framework is presented, which treats image completion, texture synthesis and image inpainting in a unified manner. In order to be able to avoid the occurrence of visually inconsistent results, we pose all of the above image-editing tasks in the form of a discrete global optimization problem. The objective function of this problem is always well-defined, and corresponds to the energy of a discrete Markov Random Field (MRF). For efficiently optimizing this MRF, a novel opti-mization scheme, called Priority-BP, is then proposed, which carries two very important extensions over the standard Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm:  ” priority-based message scheduling ” and  ” dynamic label pruning”. These two extensions work in cooperation to deal with the intolerable computational cost of BP, which is caused by the huge number of labels associated with our MRF. Moreover, both of our extensions are generic, since they do not rely on the use of domain-specific prior knowledge. They can therefore be applied to any MRF, i.e to a very wide class of problems in image processing and computer vision, thus managing to resolve what is currently considered as one major limitation of the Belief Propagation algorithm: its inefficiency in handling MRFs with very large discrete state-spaces. Experimental results on a wide variety of input images are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our image-completion framework for tasks such as object removal, texture synthesis, text removal and image inpainting.},

The authors state that syntactic approaches, using parsing, are untenable because the great variety of possible expressions makes it impossible to provide an a priori syntax definition for all possible expressions. This, combined with the computational complexity of parsing, motivates them to instead use a large collection of procedurally-coded recognition rules. Their comment about a priori syntax definition requires some clarification: any recognition method, including procedurally-coded rules, implicitly or explicitly defines the syntax of recognizable expressions. Apparently Okamoto et al. find it easier and more practical to provide an implicit syntax definition, coded as procedural rules, rather than an explicit syntax definition, coded as grammar rules.},

    abstract = {A successful representation of objects in literature is as a collection of patches, or parts, with a certain appearance and position. The relative locations of the different parts of an object are constrained by the geometry of the object. Going beyond a single object, consider a collection of images of a particular scene category containing multiple (recurring) objects. The parts belonging to different objects are not constrained by such a geometry. However, the objects themselves, arguably due to their semantic relationships, demonstrate a pattern in their relative locations. Hence, analyzing the interactions among the parts across the collection of images can allow for extraction of the foreground objects, and analyzing the interactions among these objects can allow for a semantically meaningful grouping of these objects, which characterizes the entire scene. These groupings are typically hierarchical. We introduce hierarchical semantics of objects (hSO) that captures this hierarchical grouping. We propose an approach for the unsupervised learning of the hSO from a collection of images of a particular scene. We also demonstrate the use of the hSO in providing context for enhanced object localization in the presence of significant occlusions, and show its superior performance over a fully connected graphical model for the same task.},

@article{Qi2005Eigenvalues,
    abstract = {In this paper, we define the symmetric hyperdeterminant, eigenvalues and E-eigenvalues of a real supersymmetric tensor. We show that eigenvalues are roots of a one-dimensional polynomial, and when the order of the tensor is even, E-eigenvalues are roots of another one-dimensional polynomial. These two one-dimensional polynomials are associated with the symmetric hyperdeterminant. We call them the characteristic polynomial and the E-characteristic polynomial of that supersymmetric tensor. Real eigenvalues (E-eigenvalues) with real eigenvectors (E-eigenvectors) are called H-eigenvalues (Z-eigenvalues). When the order of the supersymmetric tensor is even, H-eigenvalues (Z-eigenvalues) exist and the supersymmetric tensor is positive definite if and only if all of its H-eigenvalues (Z-eigenvalues) are positive. An  inlMMLBox -order  n -dimensional supersymmetric tensor where  m  is even has exactly  n ( m −1) n −1  eigenvalues, and the number of its E-eigenvalues is strictly less than  n ( m −1) n −1  when  m ≥4 . We show that the product of all the eigenvalues is equal to the value of the symmetric hyperdeterminant, while the sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the diagonal elements of that supersymmetric tensor, multiplied by  ( m −1) n −1 . The  n ( m −1) n −1  eigenvalues are distributed in  n  disks in  inlMMLBox . The centers and radii of these  n  disks are the diagonal elements, and the sums of the absolute values of the corresponding off-diagonal elements, of that supersymmetric tensor. On the other hand, E-eigenvalues are invariant under orthogonal transformations.},

    abstract = {Abstract--- This paper describes techniques to perform efficient and accurate target recognition in difficult domains. In order to accurately model small, irregularly shaped targets, the target objects and images are represented by their edge maps, with a local orientation associated with each edge pixel. Threedimensional objects are modeled by a set of two-dimensional views of the object. Translation, rotation, and scaling of the views are allowed to approximate full three-dimensional motion of the object. A version of the Hausdorff measure that incorporates both location and orientation information is used to determine which positions of each object model are reported as possible target locations. These positions are determined efficiently through the examination of a hierarchical cell decomposition of the transformation space. This allows large volumes of the space to be pruned quickly. Additional techniques are used to decrease the computation time required by the method when matching is performed against a catalog of object models. The probability that this measure will yield a false alarm and efficient methods for estimating this probability at run-time are considered in detail. This information can be used to maintain a low false alarm rate or to rank competing hypotheses based on their likelihood of being a false alarm. Finally, results of the system recognizing objects in infrared and intensity images are given. I.},

@book{Bod2003Probabilistic,
    abstract = {For the past forty years, linguistics has been dominated by the idea that language is categorical and linguistic competence discrete. It has become increasingly clear, however, that many levels of representation, from phonemes to sentence structure, show probabilistic properties, as does the language faculty. Probabilistic linguistics conceptualizes categories as distributions and views knowledge of language not as a minimal set of categorical constraints but as a set of gradient rules that may be characterized by a statistical distribution. Whereas categorical approaches focus on the endpoints of distributions of linguistic phenomena, probabilistic approaches focus on the gradient middle ground. Probabilistic linguistics integrates all the progress made by linguistics thus far with a probabilistic perspective.<br /> <br /> This book presents a comprehensive introduction to probabilistic approaches to linguistic inquiry. It covers the application of probabilistic techniques to phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, language acquisition, psycholinguistics, historical linguistics, and sociolinguistics. It also includes a tutorial on elementary probability theory and probabilistic grammars.},

Given an input image, we retrieve its best matches from a large database with annotated images using our modified, coarse-to-fine SIFT flow algorithm that aligns the structures within two images. Based on the dense scene correspondence obtained from the SIFT flow, our system warps the existing annotations, and integrates multiple cues in a Markov random field framework to segment and recognize the query image. Promising experimental results have been achieved by our nonparametric scene parsing system on a challenging database. Compared to existing object recognition approaches that require training for each object category, our system is easy to implement, has few parameters, and embeds contextual information naturally in the retrieval/alignment procedure.},

Spectral clustering techniques generate embeddings that constitute an example of directional data and can result in different shapes on a hypersphere (depending on the original structure). Other examples of directional data include text and some sub-domains of bioinformatics. The Watson distribution for directional data presents a tractable form and has more modeling capability than the simple von Mises-Fisher distribution. In this paper, we present a generative model of mixtures of Watson distributions on a hypersphere and derive numerical approximations of the parameters in an Expectation Maximization (EM) setting. This model also allows us to present an explanation for choosing the right embedding dimension for spectral clustering. We analyze the algorithm on a generated example and demonstrate its superiority over the existing algorithms through results on real datasets. 1},

They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.},

@article{Kimia2003Euler,
    abstract = {In this paper we address the curve completion problem, e.g., the geometric continuation of boundaries of objects which are temporarily interrupted by occlusion. Also known as the gap completion or shape completion problem, this problem is a significant element of perceptual grouping of edge elements and has been approached by using cubic splines or biarcs which minimize total curvature squared (elastica), as motivated by a physical analogy. Our approach is motivated by railroad design methods of the early 1900's which connect two rail segments by  ” transition curves”, and by the work of Knuth on mathematical typography. We propose that in using an energy minimizing solution completion curves should not penalize curvature as in elastica but curvature variation. The minimization of total curvature variation leads to an Euler Spiral solution, a curve whose curvature varies linearly with arclength. We reduce the construction of this curve from a pair of points and tangents at these points to solving a nonlinear system of equations involving Fresnel Integrals, whose solution relies on optimization from a suitable initial condition constrained to satisfy given boundary conditions. Since the choice of an appropriate initial curve is critical in this optimization, we analytically derive an optimal solution in the class of biarc curves, which is then used as the initial curve. The resulting interpolations yield intuitive interpolation across gaps and occlusions, and are extensible, in contrast to the scale-invariant version of elastica. In addition, Euler Spiral segments can be used in other applications of curve completions, e.g., modeling boundary segments between curvature extrema or modeling skeletal branch geometry.},

    abstract = {We introduce a Probabilistic Grammar-Markov Model (PGMM) which couples probabilistic context free grammars and Markov Random Fields. These PGMMs are generative models defined over attributed features and are used to detect and classify objects in natural images. PGMMs are designed so that they can perform rapid inference, parameter learning, and the more difficult task of structure induction. PGMMs can deal with unknown 2D pose (position, orientation, and scale) in both inference and learning, different appearances, or aspects, of the model. The PGMMs can be learnt in an unsupervised manner where the image can contain one of an unknown number of objects of different categories or even be pure background. We first study the weakly supervised case, where each image contains an example of the (single) object of interest, and then generalize to less supervised cases. The goal of this paper is theoretical but, to provide proof of concept, we demonstrate results from this approach on a subset of the Caltech dataset (learning on a training set and evaluating on a testing set). Our results are generally comparable with the current state of the art, and our inference is performed in less than five seconds.},

@article{zhu-mumford,
    abstract = {This exploratory paper quests for a stochastic and context sensitive grammar of images. The grammar should achieve the following four objectives and thus serves as a unified framework of representation, learning, and recognition for a large number of object categories. (i) The grammar represents both the hierarchical decompositions from scenes, to objects, parts, primitives and pixels by terminal and nonterminal nodes and the contexts for spatial and functional relations by horizontal links between the nodes. It formulates each object category as the set of all possible valid configurations produced by the grammar. (ii) The grammar is embodied in a simple And-Or graph representation where each Or-node points to alternative sub-configurations and an And-node is decomposed into a number of components. This representation supports recursive top-down/bottom-up procedures for image parsing under the Bayesian framework and make it convenient to scale up in complexity. Given an input image, the image parsing task constructs a most probable parse graph on-the-fly as the output interpretation and this parse graph is a subgraph of the And-Or graph after making choice on the Or-nodes. (iii) A probabilistic model is defined on this And-Or graph representation to account for the natural occurrence frequency of objects and parts as well as their relations. This model is learned from a relatively small training set per category and then sampled to synthesize a large number of configurations to cover novel object instances in the test set. This generalization capability is mostly missing in discriminative machine learning methods and can largely improve recognition performance in experiments. (iv) To fill the well-known semantic gap between symbols and raw signals, the grammar includes a series of visual dictionaries and organizes them through graph composition. At the bottom-level the dictionary is a set of image primitives each having a number of anchor points with open bonds to link with other primitives. These primitives can be combined to form larger and larger graph structures for parts and objects. The ambiguities in inferring local primitives shall be resolved through top-down computation using larger structures. Finally these primitives forms a primal sketch representation which will generate the input image with every pixels explained. The proposal grammar integrates three prominent representations in the literature: stochastic grammars for composition, Markov (or graphical) models for contexts, and sparse coding with primitives (wavelets). It also combines the structure-based and appearance based methods in the vision literature. Finally the paper presents three case studies to illustrate the proposed grammar.},

    abstract = {It is widely conjectured that the excellent ROC performance of biological vision systems is due in large part to the exploitation of context at each of many levels in a part/whole hierarchy. We propose a mathematical framework (a "composition machine") for constructing probabilistic hierarchical image models, designed to accommodate arbitrary contextual relationships, and we build a demonstration system for reading Massachusetts license plates in an image set collected at Logan Airport. The demonstration system detects and correctly reads more than 98\% of the plates, with a negligible rate of false detection. Unlike a formal grammar, the architecture of a composition machine does not exclude the sharing of sub-parts among multiple entities, and does not limit interpretations to single trees (e.g. a scene can have multiple license plates, or no plates at all). In this sense, the architecture is more like a general Bayesian network than a formal grammar. On the other hand, unlike a Bayesian network, the distribution is non-Markovian, and therefore more like a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar. The conceptualization and construction of a composition machine is facilitated by its formulation as the result of a series of non-Markovian perturbations of a "Markov backbone."},

    abstract = {While image registration has been studied in different areas of computer vision, aligning images depicting different scenes remains a challenging problem, closer to recognition than to image matching. Analogous to optical flow, where an image is aligned to its temporally adjacent frame, we propose  SIFT flow , a method to align an image to its neighbors in a large image collection consisting of a variety of scenes. For a query image, histogram intersection on a bag-of-visual-words representation is used to find the set of nearest neighbors in the database. The SIFT flow algorithm then consists of matching densely sampled SIFT features between the two images, while preserving spatial discontinuities. The use of SIFT features allows robust matching across different scene/object appearances and the discontinuity-preserving spatial model allows matching of objects located at different parts of the scene. Experiments show that the proposed approach is able to robustly align complicated scenes with large spatial distortions. We collect a large database of videos and apply the SIFT flow algorithm to two applications: (i) motion field prediction from a single static image and (ii) motion synthesis via transfer of moving objects.},

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D.

We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.},

Recently the problem of determining the best, in the least-squares sense, rank-1 approximation to a higher-order tensor was studied and an iterative method that extends the wellknown power method for matriceswasproposed for itssolution. Thishigher-order power method is also proposed for the special but important class of supersymmetric tensors, with no change. A simplified version, adapted to the special structure of the supersymmetric problem, is deemed unreliable, asitsconvergence isnot guaranteed. The aim of thispaper isto show that a symmetric version of the above method converges under assumptions of convexity (or concavity) for the functional induced by the tensor in question, assumptions that are very often satisfied in practical applications. The use of this version entails significant savings in computational complexity as compared to the unconstrained higher-order power method. Furthermore, a novel method for initializing the iterative processisdeveloped which hasbeen observed to yield an estimate that liescloser to the global optimum than the initialization suggested before. Moreover, its proximity to the global optimum is a priori quantifiable. In the course of the analysis, some important properties that the supersymmetry of a tensor implies for its square matrix unfolding are also studied.},

@proceedings{Parikh2007Hierarchical,
    abstract = {We introduce hSOs: hierarchical semantics of objects. An hSO is learnt from a collection of images taken from a particular scene category. The hSO captures the interactions between the objects that tend to co-occur in the scene, and hence are potentially semantically related. Such relationships are typically hierarchical. For example, in a collection of images taken in a living room scene, the TV, DVD player and coffee-table co-occur frequently. The TV and the DVD player are more closely related to each other than the coffee table, and this can be learnt from the fact that the two are located at similar relative locations across images, while the coffee table is somewhat arbitrarily placed. The goal of this paper is to learn this hierarchy that characterizes the scene. The proposed approach, being entirely unsupervised, can detect the parts of the images that belong to the foreground objects, cluster these parts to represent objects, and provide an understanding of the scene by hierarchically clustering these objects in a semantically meaningful way - all from a collection of unlabeled images of a particular scene category. In addition to providing the semantic layout of the scene, learnt hSOs can have several useful applications such as compact scene representation for scene category classification and providing context for enhanced object detection.},

Focusing on structural SVMs, we provide and explore algorithms for two different classes of approximate training algorithms, which we call undergenerating (e.g., greedy) and overgenerating (e.g., relaxations) algorithms. We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of both types of approximate trained structural SVMs, focusing on fully connected pairwise Markov random fields. We find that models trained with overgenerating methods have theoretic advantages over undergenerating methods, are empirically robust relative to their undergenerating brethren, and relaxed trained models favor non-fractional predictions from relaxed predictors.},

Our method learns object models in a weakly-supervised fashion, without requiring the specification of object locations nor pixel masks in the training data. We represent object models as cliques of fully-interconnected parts, exploiting only the pairwise geometric relationships between them. The use of pairwise relationships enables our algorithm to successfully overcome several problems that are common to previously-published methods. Even though our algorithm can easily incorporate local appearance information from richer features, we purposefully do not use them in order to demonstrate that simple geometric relationships can match (or exceed) the performance of state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms.},

@article{Hinton2006Fast,
    abstract = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

@article{Lazebnik2005Sparse,
    abstract = {This paper introduces a texture representation suitable for recognizing images of textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint changes and nonrigid deformations. At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of affine Harris and Laplacian regions is found in the image. Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1,000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints.},

    abstract = {This paper presents a method for recognizing scene categories based on approximate global geometric correspondence. This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting "spatial pyramid" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba's "gist" and Lowe's SIFT descriptors.},

We present a novel method for generic visual categorization: the problem of identifying the object content of natural images while generalizing across variations inherent to the object class. This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Na\"{i}ve Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information. 1.},

    abstract = {Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a well-known technique for finding the correlations between two sets of multi-dimensional variables. It projects both sets of variables into a lower-dimensional space in which they are maximally correlated. CCA is commonly applied for supervised dimensionality reduction, in which one of the multi-dimensional variables is derived from the class label. It has been shown that CCA can be formulated as a least squares problem in the binaryclass case. However, their relationship in the more general setting remains unclear. In this paper, we show that, under a mild condition which tends to hold for high-dimensional data, CCA in multi-label classifications can be formulated as a least squares problem. Based on this equivalence relationship, we propose several CCA extensions including sparse CCA using 1-norm regularization. Experiments on multi-label data sets confirm the established equivalence relationship. Results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CCA extensions.},

@inproceedings{Mikolajczyk2002Affine,
    abstract = {  This paper presents a novel approach for detecting affine invariant interest points. Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas: 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. Amulti-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images.},
