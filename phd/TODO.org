* Making an inkscape interface
  - take input from inkscape: user draws a curve, tags it somehow
  - send log messages from inkscape
    - either find or create a textbox with a fixed id and distinctive
      formatting
    - change the text in it to show log messages
  - user interaction
    - create training sets
    - get sample sets
    - get parse labelings
    - run particular experiments on particular data
    - somehow specify sdf's or interact with them??? easy enough to do
      with recursive grouping, i suppose. that's a reasonable way to
      look at them, but not necessarily a fun way to make them
    - make sdf's: can just duplicate a curve and use path editing tool
      to break at specific points?
    - load curves from file
    - specify an experiment, get a sort of template frame, put stuff
      where you want it
      - write the template in svg with special ids
    - have opaque tokens to represent things that aren't easily
      representable, like sdf's? put like filename or whatever in
      element's description, then it's easy to edit

* organizing experiments
  - experiments should generate figures, not tex
  - there should be no tex in experiment directory tree
  - grammars should not be represented in tex, we usually only want to
    see their samples, which is straightforward enough
  - need to figure out a reasonable way to actually depict grammars
  - would ideally have a browsable hierarchy of svgs and pngs that is
    viewable in html?
  - make directory exfigs, each experiment has a directory named with
    either a figure label or the prefix of a group of figure labels
  - svgs and pngs live in same directory

  - figure out how to handle datasets etc. nicely. ideally it would be very
    clear what the inputs to each experiment were.
  - have a list of experiments at the front? for each one,
    page-number, etc. This will probably require a lot of work.

* Writing down experimental plans/goals

* Writing up Experimental Work

* Experimental Work

* Theoretical Work

* Stylistic concerns
  - Figure out images and figures
  - What is the deal with citations inside of figure captions?
