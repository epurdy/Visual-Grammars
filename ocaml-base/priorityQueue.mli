(** Priority queues. 

    The [PriorityQueue] module provides a polymorphic and a functorial
    interface to an imperative priority queue data structure.  A queue is
    implemented by embeddeding a heap in a resizable array.

    The polymorphic interface requires that the elements in a priority queue
    are distinct w.r.t. [(=)].  The functorial interface requires that the
    elements in a priority queue are distinct w.r.t. the [equal] function in
    their [HashedType] module.  Otherwise the functions based on element
    values ([mem], [remove], [reorder_up], and [reorder_down]) may not work
    correctly. *)

type 'a order = 'a -> 'a -> bool
(** The type of priority orders on ['a].  A priority order [ord] is a
    non-strict total order where [ord a b = true] means that the priority of
    [b] is not higher than the priority of [a].  When the priority of an
    element changes, the queue must be notified using the [reorder_up] or
    [reorder_down] function. *)

type 'a t
(** The type of priority queues with element type ['a]. *)

val make: 'a order -> 'a t
(** [make ord] creates a new priority queue with order [ord]. *)

val length: 'a t -> int
(** Returns the number of elements in a queue. *)

val is_empty: 'a t -> bool
(** Tests whether a queue is empty. *)

val add: 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** Adds an elements to the queue. *)

val mem: 'a t -> 'a -> bool
(** Tests whether a queue contains a given element. *)

val first: 'a t -> 'a
(** [first q] returns an element with maximal priority contained in the queue
    [q].

    @raise Failure if [q] is empty. *)

    [q].

    contain the element [x], the function does nothing. *)

(** Removes all elements from a queue. *)
