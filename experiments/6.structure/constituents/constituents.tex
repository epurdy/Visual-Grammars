\subsection{Learning Good Constituents}

We use explicit correspondences to learn the statistically best set of
constituents when building a grammar from a single example.

Note that the arms are found as constituents!

There is a strange issue here, but I've seen it before in other code
and I don't think it's a bug. Converting to Bookstein coordinates
improves the results (or here, the results are more intuitive to me),
even though the Watson distribution shouldn't need this.

%% we can use \input{} here to incorporate dynamically generated text
