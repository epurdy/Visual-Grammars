\section{Figure out optimal single-example grammar}

We use explicit correspondences to learn the statistically best set of
constituents when building a grammar from a single example.

Note that the arms are found as constituents!

There is a strange issue here, but I've seen it before in other code
and I don't think it's a bug. Converting to Bookstein coordinates
improves the results (or here, the results are more intuitive to me),
even though the Watson distribution shouldn't need this.

Here are the constituents selected by the algorithm:

Here are the constituents that seemed most intuitive to me:
